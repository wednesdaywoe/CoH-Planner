/**
 * audit-description-divergence.cjs — powers whose in-game description promises an effect the
 * planner's own data does not carry.
 *
 * REPORTS, never asserts. City of Heroes descriptions fall behind the powers they describe, and
 * a divergence is worth surfacing to a player (docs/gaps/sets-boosts-incarnates.md, HYBRID-2).
 * But the sentence "the description is wrong" is the same sentence a parse gap produces, so
 * nothing here decides anything: it hands candidates to a person, who adjudicates the way
 * HYBRID-2 was adjudicated and adds the survivor to src/data/description-notes.ts.
 *
 *   node scripts/audit-description-divergence.cjs [--dataset <id>]
 *
 * READ THE CONTRACT, NOT exported_powers. 340 Homecoming powers (350 on Brainstorm, 0 on the
 * forks) sit in exported_powers as a record with effect groups and zero templates — Burn,
 * Instant Healing, Grounded, Consume — and are filled in downstream. Sweeping the raw tree
 * reports every one of them as an effectless power that promises effects. The contract is also
 * the honest source on its own terms: it is what the planner shows, and the note is about what
 * the planner shows.
 *
 * What it declines, and why the decline list is measured rather than guessed: an effect can
 * arrive one hop away, through a summoned entity (`EntCreate` — Sanctuary of Light's protection
 * is on the patch it drops) or a mechanic power (`Meta` — Rebirth's Resolve). This sweep does
 * not follow the hop, so those are declined and COUNTED, not silently dropped. The first draft
 * guessed at `Summon|Redirect|GrantPower` and declined nothing, which is how both of them turned
 * up as candidates.
