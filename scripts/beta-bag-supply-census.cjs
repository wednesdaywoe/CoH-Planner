/**
 * BPORT1 — supply census for the `effects` bag, across all four datasets.
 *
 * The STRIP-1 beta port (`docs/streams/strip1-beta-port.md` in the canonical repo) has to
 * decide, per bag slot, whether the reader that spends it is doing work or standing over an
 * empty shelf. Reading the reader cannot answer that: ~30 of the ~45 slot reads are
 * `atomFn(power) ?? effects.slot` seams whose right-hand side still serves atom-less
 * synthetics, so a seam that looks retired is load-bearing and a seam that looks live may
 * never fire. Only supply settles it, and **supply 0 in every supplier is the only thing
 * that proves a branch dead**.
 *
 * There are FIVE suppliers. The stream doc named three; the two it did not name are the
 * display edge's, and they are the reason a naive census reports `castTime`, `enduranceCost`
 * and `healing` as dead branches when every power's info panel spends them:
 *
 *   1. `power.effects`                — the converter-emitted bag on a generated power.
 *   2. `power.conditionalEffects[].effects` — the per-conditional delta bag. Powers get these
 *      from mode/stance gates; `expandActiveConditionals` turns an active one into a
 *      synthetic power whose whole payload is that bag, so it reaches every slot reader
 *      with no atom behind it.
 *   3. `buffPetAuraEffects`           — seven slots minted in-process from a pet entity's
 *      ally auras (`getBuffPetSources`). These are `PetEffect` rows off the pet's own
 *      abilities; no player power's atom list carries them.
 *   4. `buildDisplayEffects(power)`   — the display bag (PROD6C-3a). It spreads the authored
 *      bag and then MINTS on top of it out of `power.stats` (`enduranceCost`, `castTime`,
 *      `recharge`, `accuracy`, `range`, `radius`, `maxTargets`, `arc`), out of the damage
 *      array (`healing`), out of a summon's lifespan (`buffDuration`), and out of the nested
 *      `movement` container (the flat `fly` / `runSpeed` / `jumpSpeed` / `jumpHeight` axes).
 *      Every InfoPanel / tooltip / compare-modal read goes through this, so a slot with no
 *      converter supply can still be spent on every power that has the stat.
 *   5. `withPseudoPetEffects(power, …)` — merges a pseudo-pet's synthesized debuffs UNDER
 *      the display bag, filling keys the parent does not carry (Glue Arrow delivers its
 *      whole enhanceable debuff through a pet).
 *
 * `withTargetsHit` sits between (4) and (5) and is deliberately not counted: it rescales
 * values that are already present and mints no key, so it cannot move a slot off zero.
 *
 * The mapping in (3) lives in a `switch` inside the frozen `legacy-totals.oracle.ts` and is
 * restated here as {@link BUFF_PET_MINTED_SLOTS} rather than imported, because the oracle
 * does not export it and this census is not a reason to edit a file whose header says it
 * gains nothing. `beta-bag-supply-census.test.ts` holds the tripwire that fails when the
 * oracle's switch and this table part company. (4) and (5) are called directly — no table to
 * drift.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DECIDE. Presence is the census's answer. Whether a present value is
 * *material* — a scale-0 row, a `{translucency:…}` authoring artifact, a foe-facing value a
 * self-directed gate drops — is a per-slot credit predicate, and that adjudication is
 * BPORT4's, one seam at a time. `nonZero` below is advisory: any numeric leaf ≠ 0, which
 * over-counts a live table name beside a dead scale and is reported only to say which DEAD
 * verdicts are dead by absence and which by vacuity.
 *
 * Run: `node scripts/beta-bag-supply-census.cjs` (add `--json` for the machine-readable
 * dump). Importable: `require('./beta-bag-supply-census.cjs').census()`.
