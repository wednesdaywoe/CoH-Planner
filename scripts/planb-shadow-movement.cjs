/**
 * Plan B, Phase 2 Slice 7 — movement-buff reconstruction shadow (`effects.movement`).
 *
 * Proves that the atom list reproduces the bag's movement map WITHOUT reading the bag —
 * the precondition for migrating the movement applier in character-totals.ts:
 *
 *   BAG   — `effects.movement`, what the calc reads today: a map of axis →
 *           `{ scale, table, stackKey?, suppressible? }`, iterated by the applier and
 *           resolved through the AT table into a run/fly/jump percent.
 *   ATOMS — `movementBuffValue(power)`: base Movement atoms, with the bag's routing
 *           chain (Res → debuffResistance, self+Str → specialBuff, self+Max+scale>0 →
 *           movementCapBump, Max+slow → movementCapDebuff, slow → slow, else self /
 *           current) reproduced from `aspect` / `toWho` / `scale` / `modifierTable`,
 *           which are all on the wire.
 *
 * Checked in BOTH directions, per slot, so an over-production (an atom minting a
 * movement entry the bag never had — the failure mode a fallback CANNOT protect
 * against) is as loud as a drop.
 *
 * THE TWO SIDES NO LONGER HAVE THE SAME SHAPE, and that is the point of the fix
 * this gate was written before. The bag is a map — one value per axis — and
 * `movementBuffValue` now returns a LIST, keyed by axis plus `ignoreStrength` plus
 * `suppressible`, because a power may buff one axis twice and the map kept only the
 * last write (MOVEMAP-1: Sprint reported +50% run where the game gives +100%). So a
 * bag entry is graded against the atom entries FOR ITS AXIS, and an axis carrying
 * more than one lands in its own bucket:
 *
 *   agree        — the axis holds exactly one atom entry and the bag states it.
 *   split        — the axis holds several and the bag states one of them. This is the
 *                  bag being wrong on purpose; it is what MOVEMAP-1 fixed. Pinned by
 *                  name in EXPECTED_SPLITS, so a NEW one is loud and so is a lost one
 *                  (which would be the fix regressing).
 *   fork         — no atom entry, because the build-agnostic reader abstains on an
 *                  archetype-forked slot; asked again per archetype (see below).
 *   silenced     — every atom on the axis is a chance-0 sentinel naming no mode, so the
 *                  reader answers EMPTY and the bag value is not spent. Pinned by name in
 *                  EXPECTED_ABSTENTIONS; not scored as agreement, because the claim that
 *                  the atoms reproduce the bag is deliberately false there.
 *   diverge      — anything else. GATES.
 *
 * Grading the axes with one entry against the bag while naming the axes with several
 * is the only honest reading available: on a split axis the bag has no second slot to
 * hold the second value, so "reproduces the bag" is a claim that cannot be true there
 * and must not be asserted.
 *
 * The three metadata axes are checked alongside the value, because the applier reads
 * all of them and two of them decide whether the buff applies at all:
 *   - `table` — a movement scale is meaningless without it (Swift's 0.1 is +35% on
 *     `Melee_SpeedRunning`, not +10%);
 *   - `stackKey` — the mutual-suppression group (`TravelBuff`); only the strongest
 *     member of a group applies, so a dropped key silently stacks CJ + SJ + SS;
 *   - `suppressible` — combat suppression (Super Speed's run buff, Fly's speed).
 *
 * SCOPE — Thunderspy movement is now COVERED (this note previously claimed the opposite
 * — "tspy has NO movement data, +0 everywhere, aspect always empty"; corrected 2026-07-19,
 * all three claims are now false). `MOVEMENT_TYPES` (bag) and `MOVEMENT_AXIS` (bridge) both
 * map tspy's `SpeedRunning`/`SpeedJumping`/`SpeedFlying` spelling onto the Run/Fly/Jump axes,
 * and the TSPY-3 step-1 typing recovery filled in `aspect` (tspy is now ~4.8% aspect-empty,
 * was ~98%), so the speed-buff-vs-travel-cap distinction IS recoverable. This gate reports
 * ~95 tspy movement axis slots (bag == atoms, 0 divergence) — real data on both sides, not a
 * vacuous agree. (TSPY-3 step 2 also mapped the bare `Friction`/`Control` respellings, but
 * `movement.rs` excludes those axes from every total by design.) Coverage still prints per
 * dataset so any genuine zero stays visible rather than hiding in a corpus-wide total.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE, stated because it looks covered and is not: the `slow`
 * map's SPLIT key. Collapsing `selfSlowValue` back to one entry per axis leaves every
 * number here green, because no power in the corpus reaches this gate with more than one
 * self-directed slow entry on an axis. The two that did — Rebirth's Aerobatics and Solar
 * Glide, whose `+0.5 / -0.5` pairs are the reason `slow` became atom-native at all — now
 * abstain outright, every atom they carry being a chance-0 sentinel. The key is graded by
 * a constructed case instead, `the_minus_half_of_a_pair_splits_on_the_same_key_as_the_plus`
 * in crates/coh_math/src/appliers/movement.rs: a corpus cannot grade a scope nothing in
 * it violates. Verified by mutation — that collapse is the one mutant this gate survives.
 *
 * Exit code is nonzero on any divergence — this GATES.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/planb-shadow-movement.cjs
 *   node scripts/planb-shadow-movement.cjs --dataset homecoming
 *   node scripts/planb-shadow-movement.cjs --power "Super Speed"
 *
 * ARCHETYPE FORK: a slot the converter resolved across the whole roster reads as
 * `undefined` from the build-agnostic atom readers and populated in the bag. That is
 * not a divergence — it is checked, per archetype, through
 * `planb-shadow-sweep.forkResolvedViews`, and counted separately in the summary.
