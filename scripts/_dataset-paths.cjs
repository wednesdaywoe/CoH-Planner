/**
 * Shared CLI/path helper for the conversion scripts in this folder.
 *
 * Each script writes generated TypeScript into `src/data/`. As individual
 * data files migrate into `src/data/datasets/<id>/`, the script that
 * regenerates them needs to route to the dataset folder instead of the
 * legacy path (otherwise it clobbers the runtime facade with raw data).
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     const { parseDatasetArg, datasetPath, dataPath } = require('./_dataset-paths.cjs');
 *     const datasetId = parseDatasetArg();          // "homecoming" by default
 *     const atTablesOut = datasetPath(datasetId, 'at-tables.ts');
 *     const legacyOut   = dataPath('io-sets-raw.ts');
 *
 * The `--dataset <id>` flag is recognized in `process.argv`. If absent,
 * defaults to `'homecoming'` so existing muscle memory keeps working.
 *
 * `datasetPath` is for files that have ALREADY moved into the dataset
 * folder (per MULTI_DATASET_PLAN.md). `dataPath` is for files that
 * haven't migrated yet — when they migrate, switch their generator over
 * to `datasetPath`.

/**
 * Every dataset the pipeline builds, in regen order. The single source — the roster
 * was copy-pasted across ~25 scripts, and a paste is how a new dataset gets converted
 * by some of them and silently skipped by the rest (the DSH8 Clarion-leak shape).
 *
 * `brainstorm` is Homecoming's open beta (the Brainstorm server), a first-class shipping
 * dataset rather than a ring Homecoming reads. It trails HC's content by one release
 * cycle in the other direction: it holds what live is ABOUT to get.
 *
 * Adding a name here does NOT finish the job. A site keyed BY dataset name — an
 * expected-count table, a per-fork floor — keeps its old keys and goes quiet on the
 * new one rather than failing. `scripts/audit-dataset-roster.cjs` is the census that
 * finds those.
