/**
 * BPORT4 — reader census for the `effects` bag: every seam, and what it reads after the strip.
 *
 * BPORT1 measured SUPPLY per slot. This measures the other half: every place the bag is READ,
 * what that read binds to, and whether the supplier behind it survives BPORT7's regen. The
 * stream doc's population came from a file-level `grep` for `.effects`, and that instrument is
 * wrong in three separate directions — each of which this script fixes, and each of which
 * changed a verdict:
 *
 *   1. **It counts prose.** A doc comment naming the slot an atom query replaces
 *      (`atom-query.ts` does this 49 times) is not a read. Comments are stripped by a scanner
 *      here, not by a line-prefix heuristic, so a trailing `// … effects.foo` goes too.
 *   2. **It cannot see an alias.** `const e = power.effects` followed by `e.tohitBuff` is a bag
 *      read that no `effects.<slot>` regex matches. Three of the port's own files bind the bag
 *      to `e`, `bag` or `nextEffects` and then read it through the alias.
 *   3. **It cannot see a roster.** The same blindness BPORT3 found on `resolvePowerMagnitudes`:
 *      a reader that walks `SELF_BUFF_KEYS` or `FOE_DEBUFF_KEYS` names no slot at the read site.
 *      BPORT1's `DYNAMIC_READ_SITES` is the register for those and is consulted here.
 *
 * And it over-counts files in the other direction: a `.effects` on a set bonus tier, a pet
 * ability, a proc entry or a `ConditionalEffect` is not the power bag at all. Those are
 * separated by BINDING, not by name.
 *
 * WHAT A VERDICT MEANS. The strip empties supplier 1 (`power.effects`) and nothing else —
 * measured, not assumed: the canonical repo finished its own strip and still ships 498
 * `"effects"` keys in its homecoming powersets, every one of them a
 * `conditionalEffects[].effects`. So a seam survives iff the slot it reads has supply from 2-5
 * AND the reader can reach that supplier:
 *
 *   supplier 2 (conditional bag)   reaches a reader that reads a `ConditionalEffect`
 *   supplier 3 (buff-pet aura)     reaches a buff-pet aura consumer
 *   suppliers 4/5 (display mints)  reach the display closure — the files that build a display
 *                                  bag, plus the files those hand one to as a prop
 *
 * The prop hop is the question BPORT1 deferred ("a surface handed the bag as a prop is
 * undetectable by import edge"). It is answered here by derivation rather than by a table:
 * {@link propFeeds} finds every `<Component effects={…}>` JSX attribute, resolves the component
 * to the file that declares it, and reports whether EVERY feeder is a display-bag builder.
 *
 * Run: `node scripts/beta-bag-reader-census.cjs` (`--json` for the dump, `--sibling <path>` to
 * partition the population against the other repo the way the stream doc did).

 * the finder. The sibling comparison ran the FINDER over canonical and asked whether the slot

 * caught it the only way it could be caught — by opening canonical's copy. Six of the eight
 * were wrong: canonical's `getPowerDominationSummary` is byte-identical to this one and reads
 * `effects[key]` exactly as it does, so "carry canonical's arm" named an arm that does not
 * exist. The other two (`ROUTED_SUBTYPES`) were right by accident.
 *
 * The register's own `symbol` is the decidable question: a roster of bag-slot names has one
 * purpose, so canonical still declaring it means canonical still reads through it. That is
