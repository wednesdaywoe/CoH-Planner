/**
 * Every key the converter emits onto a Power or a Powerset must be declared on the type.
 *
 * The gap this closes is structural, not cosmetic. Generated modules are written as
 * `export const Aim: Power = { … }`, so an undeclared key is an excess-property error and
 * tsc is supposed to be the guard — but only the beta's tsc ever runs. The rebuild's dies
 * early on missing React deps and never reaches a generated file, so for as long as the two
 * repos held different copies of this type, nothing graded the rebuild's at all.
 *
 * It went unnoticed at scale. When power.ts was reconciled on 2026-08-21 the rebuild's copy
 * was missing fourteen fields its own converter writes, `autoIssue` and `free` among them,
 * on all 8,500-odd powers across the three forks. Same class as the `grantEdges` find that
 * opened FORK-2: emitted, consumed, never declared.
 *
 * Reading the shipped data rather than the type keeps the direction right — the export is
 * the source of truth, so an emitted key is the evidence and the type is what has to answer
 * for it.
