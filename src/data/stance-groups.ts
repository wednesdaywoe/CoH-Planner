/**
 * Global "stance" selectors — sets whose powers are gated on a mutually
 * exclusive caster stance.
 *
 * Single source of truth: the stance lives in the **parent power's
 * `activeSubPower`** (build-scoped, serialized, the same field Dual Pistols ammo
 * uses). Taking the parent (Bio Armor's Adaptation / "Evolution", Staff
 * Fighting's Staff Mastery) auto-grants the stance/form sub-powers as chips, and
 * selecting one sets `parent.activeSubPower`. Every consumer derives the active
 * stance from that field:
 *   - the dashboard calc (`expandActiveConditionals` via `stanceAdjusterOverrides`),
 *   - the InfoPanel conditional merge, and
 *   - the header + per-power stance selectors (which write it back via
 *     `setActiveSubPower`).
 *
 * The mode-gated `conditionalEffects` on each power are keyed by the bare
 * conditional `id` (e.g. `defensiveadaptation`, `perfection_of_body_level_3`);
 * `subPower` maps each option to the `activeSubPower` value that selects it.
 *
 *  - **Bio Armor — Adaptation** (Defensive / Offensive / Efficient): drives
 *    survivability totals. Note the data id for the Efficient stance is the
 *    legacy "rested"; the sub-power and label use the in-game "Efficient".
 *  - **Staff Fighting — Form / Perfection** (Body / Mind / Soul): the form chip
 *    sets the stance; selecting it assumes max (Lvl 3) Perfection of that form,
 *    applying the finisher bonuses on Sky Splitter / Eye of the Storm.
