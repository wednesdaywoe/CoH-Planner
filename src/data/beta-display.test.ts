/**
 * BPORT3 — the adjudication of the six beta-only bag readers.
 *
 * These six have no canonical counterpart, so there is no post-strip verdict to copy: each
 * one owes its own answer to "does BPORT7's regen break this, and what does it read".
 * `legacy-totals.oracle.ts` is the sixth and belongs to BPORT5. The other five split three
 * ways, and this file pins the three verdicts, because each rests on a source-shape fact
 * that a later edit can quietly reverse.
 *
 * Why here rather than in the census: the census measures SUPPLY, per slot. Every claim
 * below is about a READER — which bag reaches it, whose keys it walks, what its callers hand
 * it — and none of them is expressible as a supply count. Two of the five are invisible to a
 * supply census by construction: they name no slot at all.

/**
 * The `summon` slot, which is BPORT3's one finding that changes another item's scope.
 *
 * `summon` has 1,435 carriers across the four datasets and no mint, so it dies exactly when
 * BPORT7's regen lands. BPORT2 found this on `BuffPetAuraToggle.tsx` and deferred that ONE
 * file to BPORT7, because a reader can only move to `power.summon` once a converter writes
 * it. The same crossing was owed to every reader the census named — eleven files, forty-four
 * sites — and the beta shipped zero powers carrying a top-level `summon`, so none of them
 * may move first. Canonical recorded the cost of getting this wrong in `Power.summon`'s own
 * doc: retiring the bag "took the pets with it and 400+ summoners per fork went dark"
 * (ENT-22).
 *
 * BPORT7 crossed it. The twenty-four power-bag reads (twenty-three own, one alias) now read
 * `power.summon`, and `buildDisplayEffects` mints the display bag's `summon` from the top
 * level, because the bag spread no longer carries it. What the roster below pins is what
 * SURVIVES: the eighteen display-bag reads in three files, all `param` binding — they read
 * the bag the mint builds, not the power's, so the regen does not touch them.
 *
 * Counts are per-file match counts, not per-file line counts. The first census of this taken
 * by eye read nine files and twenty-two sites, because a line-oriented grep counts a JSX
 * block rendering six fields of the same object once and missed `DamageBlock.tsx` outright.
 *
 * BPORT4 added the eleventh, and the reason it was missing is the same class of blindness
 * this entry found on `resolvePowerMagnitudes`: `PowersetCompareModal` binds the bag to a
 * local (`const e = power.effects`) and reads `e?.summon` through it, which no
 * `effects.summon` pattern can see. The roster is therefore no longer taken with a regex —
 * it comes from the reader census's finders, so an alias, a chained receiver
 * (`getArchetype(…)?.inherent?.effects`) or a comment cannot move it again without the
 * finders moving too.
