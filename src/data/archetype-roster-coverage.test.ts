/**
 * Every converted powerset is pickable, and every pickable powerset was converted.
 *
 * An archetype's `primarySets` / `secondarySets` decide what the Build Identity menu offers,
 * and they are a hand-maintained list in each dataset's `archetypes.ts`. The converter writes
 * powerset directories; nothing joined the two, so a set could convert cleanly, ship in the
 * contract, pass every corpus gate — and be unpickable, because no roster named it.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical (ROSTER-1). Homecoming shipped Sonic Melee, Wind Control and the
 * Stalker's Stone Armor unreachable, and Brainstorm added Light Affinity and Sonic Aura to the
 * same silence: 23 powersets across the two forks, converted and invisible. The roster generator
 * (`scripts/generate-archetypes.cjs`) derives these lists from disk and would have been right,
 * but it is a bootstrap script and no regen step runs it.
 *
 * Both directions, because each catches a different mistake: a set on disk and off the roster is
 * unreachable content, and a set on the roster with no directory is a menu entry that resolves to
 * nothing. The two read different halves of the tree, and the asymmetry is real rather than
 * convenient: the rosters OWN `primary/` and `secondary/`, so anything there and unnamed is a
 * finding, while a Kheldian names its `epic/` form sets in those same two arrays — so the
 * dangling check has to resolve against `epic/` too or it would report the forms as broken.
