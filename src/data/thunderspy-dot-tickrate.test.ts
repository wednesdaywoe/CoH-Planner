/**
 * Thunderspy DoT tickRate recovery.
 *
 * Thunderspy uses a pre-Homecoming binary format whose AttribMod templates store
 * attribs as string names; the parser's `_parse_effect_template_thunderspy` scans
 * the tail for the modifier table, then reads the canonical CoH post-table block
 * (scale, duration, magnitude, two expr arrays, delay, application_period, …).
 * It originally stopped after duration, so `application_period` (the DoT tick
 * interval) was never captured: every Thunderspy DoT exported `duration` with NO
 * `tickRate`, and the calc — which requires BOTH duration>0 and tickRate>0 — never
 * surfaced a DoT line. 372 damage blocks had a duration and 0 had a tickRate.
 *
 * Period lives at table+28 (delay at table+24, tick_chance at table+32), identical
 * to HC's Parse7 layout. These lock the fix against a regen silently dropping it.
 *
 * NB: Thunderspy rebalanced several DoTs away from their HC timing — its player
 * Gloom is a 1.5s / 0.2s window (8 ticks), not HC's 3.6s / 0.5s — so the duration
 * is asserted at the Thunderspy-native value, not the HC one.
