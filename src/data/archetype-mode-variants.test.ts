/**
 * The export answers the form question, on every fork, for archetype powersets.
 *
 * This is the census the hand tables hid. Rebirth's Kheldian redirects were carried as a
 * community mapping captured 2026-05-04, standing in for a Parse6 `Redirect` table nobody had
 * parsed yet; Thunderspy's Primalist shells were carried as a generated-but-parallel silo. Both
 * outlived their reason — the parser produces `modeVariants` on all three forks now — and
 * neither had a gate that would go red when the export caught up, because a hand table and the
 * export agreeing is not something either side measures. FORK-2 retired them; this is what
 * stands in their place.
 *
 * `pool-epic-mode-gates.test.ts` pins the same field across pool and epic powers and states
 * that both forks are structurally zero there. That is true of POOLS, and it is exactly why
 * this file exists: the Kheldian and Primalist carriers live in archetype powersets, which that
 * sweep never walks. Read the two together — neither alone covers the field.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE, stated rather than assumed:
 *   - A RENAMED variant target. Mutation-tested and deliberately left uncaught: the engine's
 *     `with_mode_variant` skips `internalName` when it overlays (the effective power keeps the
 *     base's identity, which every projected value is keyed to) and takes the atoms carried on
 *     the variant itself, so the target name is evidence for a reader, not an input to a number.
 *     A gate that went red on it would be pinning a string nothing reads.
 *   - Whether a variant's NUMBERS are right. It grades the redirect table's shape and reach,
 *     not the atoms behind it; `serverParity` and the projection corpus own the magnitudes.
 *   - A mode published by `setsModes` that redirects nothing. That is a legitimate shape (Power
 *     Boost's `BoostPower`), so its absence here is not evidence of a defect.
 *   - Homecoming's Kheldian population being SMALL is correct, not a hole: HC grants Nova and
 *     Dwarf as whole powersets of separately-slottable attacks, so only the two always-available
 *     inherent attacks per AT are redirected. Rebirth redirects the human attacks instead. The
 *     per-fork totals below encode that difference deliberately.
