/**
 * Rebirth "Universal Debuff" category (Witchcraft / Superior Witchcraft).
 *
 * These are multi-aspect debuff event sets (pieces span Defense + Slow + ToHit
 * Debuff). The binary tags them `ECToHitDeBuff` (one of their aspects), which made
 * the exporter label every power that can slot them — via ANY of those aspects —
 * as accepting "To Hit Debuff". That wrongly implied Tar Patch (a Slow/-Res patch
 * with NO to-hit debuff) takes ToHit-debuff sets. The record's own GroupName says
 * "Universal Debuff" and always did — first restored by a curated override, then read
 * straight off the record at BOOST-2 when the whole inference chain came out.
