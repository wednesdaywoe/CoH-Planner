/**
 * Adjudicated description notes — powers whose in-game text promises something the planner's
 * data does not carry.
 *
 * City of Heroes descriptions fall behind the powers they describe, and a player reading a
 * promise the game no longer keeps deserves to be told. What this file is careful about is the
 * OTHER reading of the same observation: an effect a description promises and our data lacks is
 * indistinguishable, from the power alone, from an effect our parser dropped. So nothing lands
 * here from a heuristic. `scripts/audit-description-divergence.cjs` sweeps and REPORTS; a person
 * adjudicates each candidate the way HYBRID-2 was (census the shape fork-wide, find a same-fork
 * control that reads correctly), and only the survivor is written down, with its register id.
 *
 * That is also why this is not a Rule 0 violation. The rule bans hardcoding a value the export
 * owns, and the export cannot state "my own description is stale" — it has no field for it. Nor
 * is any of it branched on: the renderer asks whether a key has a note, never which power it is.
 *
 * The note's voice is deliberately unconfident. We are reporting a disagreement between two
 * sources, not ruling on it, and the player is the one standing in the game where it can be
 * settled in ten seconds.
