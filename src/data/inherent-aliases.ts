/**
 * Retired inherent `internalName`s, mapped to the name the game actually uses.
 *
 * A build stores each inherent by `internalName`, so renaming one breaks every
 * build already saved under the old name. These eight were renamed when the
 * universal inherents stopped being hand-authored and started coming out of the
 * export (INHERENT-4 / INHERENT-5): the old names were invented by the hand
 * table and match nothing in any fork's data. `PowerSurge` was worse than
 * invented — Electric Armor has a real power by that name, so one address named
 * two different powers.
 *
 * The mapping is by DISPLAY name, which is the one thing that did not change:
 * `Inherent.Prestige.PowerSlide` and `Prestige.Prestige_Sprints.prestige_DVD_Glidep`
 * both show "Prestige Power Slide". Note how little the invented names told you
 * — the five prestige sprints map across in a scrambled order, which is exactly
 * the kind of thing a hand table gets wrong and nobody notices.
 *
 * This is a one-way migration table, not a lookup: nothing should ever write an
 * old name, and the entries only ever get read when an old build is loaded.
