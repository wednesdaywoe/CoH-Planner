/**
 * The adjudicated description notes agree with the sweep, in both directions.
 *
 * A note says a power's in-game text promises something its data does not carry. Two ways that
 * goes wrong, and this grades both:
 *
 *   - A note OUTLIVES its divergence. The data is re-exported, the effect comes back, and the
 *     banner keeps telling players the description is unreliable. Every note must still be a
 *     live candidate.
 *   - A divergence arrives with NO note. Then the app is quietly showing a promise the data
 *     does not keep, which is the thing the notes exist to prevent — and it needs a person,
 *     because the same observation is what a parse gap looks like. A new candidate fails here
 *     rather than auto-generating a banner.
 *
 * So this is a set-equality tripwire, not a subset check. It is deliberately noisy on arrival of
 * anything new: the failure message is the handoff to adjudication.
 *
 * The corpus is the built `contract/` tree, which only the canonical repo holds — the beta ships
 * the same data as gzipped bundles. So the two corpus legs run there and announce themselves as
 * skipped here, the same split `lint-register-shape.cjs` rule 6 makes. The shape leg runs in both:
 * a malformed note is a malformed note wherever it is read.
