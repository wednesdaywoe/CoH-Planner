/**
 * SHOWFLAGS-2 — hidden from the Manage screen is not the same as not for sale.
 *
 * SHOWFLAGS-1 taught the converter to classify a power as `hiddenPassive`/`hiddenAuto` from
 * its `ShowInManage kFalse` + `MaxBoosts 0` flags, and both planners then read that class as
 * "never a pick". It isn't one: `ShowInManage` says only that the power gets no row on the
 * enhancement Manage screen, which every slotless power carries whether or not the game
 * sells it. Bio Armor's Adaptation and Staff Fighting's Staff Mastery are hidden there and
 * still cost a power pick, so the filter took a pick away from eight powersets on HC and its
 * mirrors — reported from the beta as "the Bio Armor Adaptation power option is missing".
 *
 * `free` is the axis that separates the two: `character_CountPowersBought`
 * (`character_level.c:447`) skips exactly the powers the game hands over, and AutoIssue
 * forces Free (`powers_load.c:950`). Every hidden row in every bundle splits cleanly on it —
 * Seismic Shockwaves and the forks' curated helpers are free, Adaptation / Staff Mastery /
 * Fate Sealed are not.
 *
 * Three legs, because the first two grade the rule and only the third would have caught the
 * original: SHOWFLAGS-1's gates asserted that hidden powers stay out of the pick list, which
 * is half a question, and stayed green over a corpus where the other half was wrong.
