/**
 * Thunderspy Support Hybrid — generic-attrib map (DSH8).
 *
 * Thunderspy stores each hybrid buff with a generic front-category token
 * (`Damage`/`Ones`/`Defense`/`Accuracy`) and all-zero aspect bytes; the REAL
 * affected attribs live in the post-`requires` index array. The bin parser now
 * relabels the front to the resolved index attribs and synthesizes the aspect
 * (see `_parse_effect_template_thunderspy` in _powers.py), so the export carries
 * real per-attrib rows like HC/Rebirth and the converter's shared branches apply:
 * `*_Dmg`@Strength → damage, `Accuracy`@Strength → accuracy, and the index-named
 * defense position (`Melee`@Current) → defMelee. Note the tspy bin names ONLY
 * the Melee position for the Support defense row (count=1 in the index array,
 * verified against the raw bytes 2026-07-07) — the earlier `Defense`→defenseAll
 * category guess overstated it, and even HC's tier-1 row is Melee/Smashing/Lethal,
 * not all 11.
 *
 * The excluded `Ones`/`Stunned` tokens are the help's "+Special" (heal- and
 * mez-strength) that HC and Rebirth both drop (team buff-strength, no self stat).
 *
 * These tests pin the fix so a re-gen can't silently drop the Support tree back
 * to empty, and pin the cross-server value agreement (tspy did not rebalance).
