/**
 * Thunderspy IO-set roster, extracted from Thunderspy's own boostsets.bin
 * (scripts/extract-rebirth-io-sets-v2.py --dataset thunderspy) instead of the
 * old placeholder that re-exported Homecoming's entire registry wholesale.
 *
 * The wholesale re-export was the root cause of two reported bug classes:
 *   1. HC-only sets that don't exist on Thunderspy leaked in (Sudden
 *      Acceleration, Synapse's Shock, Power Transfer, Hypersonic, + 13 more).
 *   2. Thunderspy-only sets were missing entirely.
 *
 * These invariants guard against a regression back to the HC roster.

/**
 * A set entry with the fields each fork states for itself removed, so two forks'
 * copies of one set can be compared for the structure they genuinely share.
 *
 * `rarity` and `type` are per-fork binary tokens (Thunderspy labels its second ATO
 * families ECATO2/ECSATO2 where Homecoming uses ECATO/ECSATO for both, and the
 * forks spell four slotting headings differently). Piece NAMES joined them in
 * 2026-08: every fork names its pieces from its own boost powers, and the strings
 * differ — Homecoming's ATO pieces carry an archetype qualifier the others don't.
 * BONUSES joined them in BOOST-5 step 2: each fork's tiers resolve from its own
 * export, and the authorings differ (HC re-rounded defense scales to 4dp and
 * offset its damage tiers +0.025), so only the tier/piece structure is shared.
