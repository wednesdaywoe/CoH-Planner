/**
 * Guard against the Steadfast/Stupefy proc mis-resolution class.
 *
 * A slotted piece resolves its effect through findProcData(piece.name, set.name).
 * When the name matches no proc-data key, findProcData falls through to its
 * set-name fallback, which returns the FIRST PROC_DATABASE entry for that set.
 * For a set with more than one special (Steadfast: +Def AND +KB Prot; Stupefy:
 * Chance-for-Stun AND Chance-for-Knockback) that silently shows the WRONG
 * effect — whichever entry the iteration order happens to reach first.
 *
 * Invariant: every proc piece in a set with >1 proc-data entry resolves by an
 * EXACT name match, never the ambiguous fallback.
 *
 * Piece names come from the boost power now, so the two sides of the match are
 * no longer written by the same hand: PROC_DATABASE is still a hand table in
 * proc-data.ts, carrying the vocabulary the extractor used to assemble. Where
 * they disagree, the exact match is lost and the ambiguous fallback is what
 * answers. The pinned list below is that disagreement, in full.

/**
 * Proc pieces whose name no longer matches their PROC_DATABASE entry, because the
 * entry spells the piece the old extractor's way. Both sides describe the same
 * global — the game says "Resistance/Defense", the table says "Damage
 * Resistance/+Def(All)" — so the fallback currently lands on the right entry, but
 * only because it sorts ahead of Steadfast's Knockback Protection. Exit condition:
 * re-source PROC_DATABASE's keys from the binary, at which point this empties.
