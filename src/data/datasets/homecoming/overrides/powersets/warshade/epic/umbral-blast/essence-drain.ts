 * Hand-written deltas applied on top of the generated power object via

 * composed file carried that the current CoD2-raw extraction does not.
 * Keep them — the CoD2 archive we convert from is a snapshot, and these
 * overrides are where current HC values live when they've drifted from
 * that snapshot. See src/data/README.md.
