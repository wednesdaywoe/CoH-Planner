/**
 * HYBRID-2 — Homecoming dropped the Melee Hybrid's status protection at T3-Radial and T4, and
 * left the tooltip claiming it. The forks kept the rows, and their tooltips are right.
 *
 * This pins an UPSTREAM fact, not a defect of ours. It exists because the observation is one
 * step from a false accusation in either direction: an absent effect a tooltip promises looks
 * exactly like a parser dropping a template, and the reason it isn't one here is measured, not
 * argued. The Parse7 reader emits packed negative mez rows on 408 Homecoming powers (564
 * carrying one at all), including `melee_genome_4` in this very file family and group position.
 * A reader that could not see the shape would have missed those too.
 *
 * So the tripwire runs both ways. If a Homecoming re-export restores the rows, the game changed
 * back and the tooltip is right again. If the forks lose them, suspect the parse — nothing about
 * Rebirth or Thunderspy should move here on its own.
