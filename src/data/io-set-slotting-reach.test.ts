/**
 * Slotting reach: can the picker actually offer every set the fork ships?
 *
 * A set is offered by a power when the set's `type` string equals one of the
 * power's `allowedSetCategories` strings. Both are the same binary field —
 * `BoostSet.GroupName`, the heading the client itself groups by — but they travel
 * to the planner down two different paths: the set's through the IO-sets extractor,
 * the power's through the bin exporter's reversed category index. Nothing else
 * compares them, so a set whose `type` no power lists simply never appears, in
 * silence, with every other guard green.
 *
 * That is how BOOST-2 sat open: four Thunderspy sets — Overwhelming Force, Subaluwa
 * and both Primalist ATOs — reached no power at all, and the labels on 25 more were
 * Homecoming's spelling of a heading Thunderspy renames. The two arms agreed with
 * each other while both disagreed with the game, which is why a same-derivation
 * cross-check could not see it; this one joins the two shipped artifacts instead.

/**
 * The class rather than the instance: a heading vocabulary is complete or it is absent.
 *
 * The three cases above each grade one *named* list — `IO_SET_CATEGORIES`,
 * `CATEGORY_PRIORITY` — and are blind to a fourth list nobody thought to name here.
 * The twin carried exactly that: an `IO_SET_TYPE_TO_CATEGORY` keyed by heading and
 * mapping all 56 to themselves, interposed between a set's `type` and a power's
 * category by `getIOSetsForCategory`, `getIOSetsForPower`, the set-bonus lookup modal
 * and the proc-potential scorer. It agreed with the data on every row, so no test
 * could have caught it by value — but it answered `undefined` for a heading it had
 * not been told about, and a heading it has not been told about is exactly what the
 * next fork ships. That is BOOST-2's failure mode rebuilt, waiting for the data to
 * move.
 *
 * So this grades no particular list. Any export keyed by slotting headings is a
 * vocabulary, and a vocabulary that is missing one is a silent drop — including one
 * added after this file was written.
 *
 * Which is the point: its first run found a third list, in this repo, that the twin
 * had nothing to do with. `SET_CATEGORY_TO_ENHANCEMENT` in `enhancement-registry.ts`
 * stated 53 of the 56 — no Guardian Archetype Sets, no Rest Buff, no Universal
 * Control Duration Sets — behind a reader that answered `|| []`, so those three
 * headings reported that nothing enhances them. It had no consumer left, and its own
 * comments called it a fallback superseded by the binary, so it was deleted rather
 * than completed; hardcoding the three missing rows would have been the Rule 0 breach
 * the table already was.
