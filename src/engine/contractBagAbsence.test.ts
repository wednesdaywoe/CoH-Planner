/**
 * The shipped engine bundle carries no power `effects` bag.
 *
 * STRIP-1's beta port emptied the bag from three surfaces, and this one is the last and the
 * least visible. The converters and the generated TS are source in this repo, so a bag coming
 * back there is a diff someone reads. `public/engine/contract/*.json.gz` is vendored build
 * output copied wholesale from canonical by `npm run build:engine`, and it is what USERS
 * download — a bag returning here is four binary blobs changing size, which nothing reads.
 *
 * The staleness half is already covered from the other side: canonical's CI runs
 * `scripts/engine-fingerprint.mjs` against this checkout, so these bundles cannot drift from
 * canonical's. That proves the copy is CURRENT; it says nothing about what is in it. This
 * grades the artifact itself, in the repo that ships it, so the claim does not rest on a chain
 * of two checks that both live somewhere else.
 *
 * The finish line is an identity, not a count. Every `effects` key in a bundle is one of:
 *
 *   - an ARRAY — not the bag at all, a different type sharing a name: a pet ability's effect
 *     list (`pet-entities`, and the same list reached through `powers[].summon`), an IO set
 *     bonus's effect list, a proc entry's. These are untouched by the strip and always will be.
 *   - an OBJECT under `conditionalEffects` — a bag, and a LIVE one. It is the supplier
 *     `expandActiveConditionals` reads to turn a stance or mode into a synthetic power, which
 *     has no atoms to be read from instead (SYNTH-1). The strip never targeted it.
 *
 * An object-valued `effects` anywhere else is the bag, and there is no third thing it could be.
 * So the check needs no slot roster and no expected number: it partitions every occurrence and
 * fails on the residue. Pre-vendor this repo shipped 13,754 of them across the four datasets
 * (3,683 / 3,161 / 3,143 / 3,767) at fourteen distinct parent sites — `powers`, `formVariants`,
 * each named `modeVariants` key, the inherent rosters, `archetypes[].inherent`. All fourteen
 * are covered by the one rule rather than enumerated, so a fifteenth is caught too.
 *
 * Non-vacuity is the other half, and it matters more here than usual: the assertion is an
 * ABSENCE over a file this test also decides how to read, so an empty bundle, a renamed
 * partition or a walk that silently visits nothing all pass by finding no bag. Each dataset
 * must therefore show powers, atoms, both surviving `effects` classes, and a bag count of zero
 * — and the roster of datasets is read off the directory rather than listed, so a fifth server
 * is graded on arrival instead of being skipped in silence.
