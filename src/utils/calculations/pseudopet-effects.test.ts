/**
 * Pseudo-pet enhanceable-effect unify.
 *
 * Location / patch powers (Glue Arrow, etc.) deliver their enhanceable debuffs
 * through a non-commandable pseudo-pet, carrying nothing on the parent power.
 * `synthesizePseudoPetEffects` lifts those debuffs into a PowerEffects fragment
 * so the parent's Power Effects block can scale them by the summoner's
 * enhancements (the pet inherits them via CopyBoosts).
 *
 * Three rules the shapes below encode, each of which this file used to assert the
 * opposite of:
 *
 *  • An `IgnoreStrength` debuff IS surfaced, carrying the mark, and renders flat.
 *    The converter reads the flag rather than discarding the template, and this
 *    merge is the only place a pseudo-pet's kit reaches the summoning power at
 *    all — so dropping the row showed nothing where the honest answer is
 *    "something the summoner's slotting does not reach" (ENT-4).
 *  • A movement key holds one value PER AXIS. Glue Arrow slows running by 0.72
 *    and caps jump height at 500 off the same table; one value per key can hold
 *    neither, and summing them gives 500.72 (ENT-5 / ENT-8).
 *  • Every row an entity supplies names the entity's own class, because that is
 *    the class its tables resolve against — not the summoner's (ENT-10).
