/**
 * Perma tracker calculations
 *
 * A power is "perma" when its effective recharge time is equal to or less than
 * its duration, meaning it can be reactivated immediately when it expires.
 *
 * "Its duration" is the CASTER-SIDE window (`selfStateWindow`) — the longest state the
 * caster is actually keeping up, never the bag's `buffDuration`, which is a plurality
 * vote over every timed effect and on a debuffing power reports the FOE's clock.
 *
 * Formula:
 *   duration       = the longest caster-side state's own duration
 *   rechargeNeeded = (baseRecharge / duration) - 1  (total +rech% required for perma)
 *   totalRecharge  = slottedRecharge + globalRecharge (combined from slotting + set bonuses)
 *   netStrength    = clamp(1 + totalRecharge, bounds.floor, bounds.cap)
 *   permaPercent   = (netStrength - 1) / rechargeNeeded * 100  (0% = no bonuses, 100% = perma)
 *   effectiveRecharge = baseRecharge / netStrength
 *
 * Every input comes from the atom stream (PERMA-2, ported from the 1.0 fork 2026-09-04).
 * The window used to be read off the `effects` bag — a `durations` map keyed by bag slot,
 * gated behind `if (!power.effects) return false` — so it answered "not eligible" for every
 * bagless power, which is what the whole corpus becomes once the writer-side strip lands here
 * (BPORT7). Agreeing with the engine is the point, because the panel gates on this predicate
 * and then renders `coh_math::perma`'s numbers. It is not the same code, though: the engine
 * derives its window from `window_slots`, a mirror of the converter's slot routing, and this
 * reads the atoms. Measured old-rule-vs-new over 21,372 entries on four forks, 0 powers lose
 * eligibility and 57 rows gain it; the two places engine and atoms still disagree are PERMA-4.

 * Check if a power is eligible for perma tracking.

 * A power is perma-eligible when keeping it active permanently is meaningful:
 * - Must be a Click power. Toggles re-apply on a tick cadence (their
 *   `buffDuration` is per-tick refresh, e.g. 0.75s, not a window between
 *   activations) and Auto powers fire automatically — neither has a perma
 *   gap to close. Charged Armor and other defense toggles were
 *   incorrectly tracked because both have recharge + per-tick duration.
 * - Must have a positive recharge AND a caster-side window to keep up — one and
 *   the same test, since `selfStateWindow` is 0 exactly when the power leaves no
 *   such state. Foe debuffs and mez don't count: those expire on the target, and
 *   the planner doesn't model refreshing them by re-firing on cadence.
 * - Perma must be REACHABLE: the cycle at the archetype's maximum recharge
 *   strength still has to fit inside the window (`recharge / bounds.cap <=
 *   duration`). This is the same comparison `calculatePermaInfo` makes for
 *   `isPerma`, evaluated at the ceiling, so eligibility and the ring can no
 *   longer disagree about what is possible.
 * - For powers that deal damage (attacks): require recharge >= 2× duration, since
 *   the duration is typically a hold/mez that roughly matches recharge (Dark Grasp).
 *   This still includes buff-attacks like Soul Drain (120s rech / 30s dur).
 * - For non-damage powers (buffs, summons): require recharge > duration, a looser
 *   threshold that includes Lightning Storm (90s rech / 60s dur).
 *
 * This replaced a `PRACTICAL_RECHARGE_CAP = 5` threshold that was wrong twice:
 * the exported ceiling is a net STRENGTH of 5.0 (i.e. +400%, not the "+500%
 * global recharge cap" its comment claimed), and it was compared against
 * `recharge/duration - 1`, so the gate actually admitted every ratio up to and
 * including 6.0. The band between was powers whose ring the planner drew and the
 * arithmetic could never fill — a large cluster sitting at exactly ratio 6.00
 * (Placate 60/10, Zapp 24/4, Wormhole and Category Five 90/15).

 * engine census reports `win 0.0, rust false` on all four Kinetics copies (the power is
 * `Kinetic_Transfer` internally on Controller and Defender), so the ring is off in the planner
