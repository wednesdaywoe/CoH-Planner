/**
 * The `protRepel` magnitude from this power's SELF-directed `Mez/Repel` protection atoms —
 * a mirror of `kbProtectionValue` (atom-query.ts) for the Repel subtype. Protection is
 * spelled as a negative `Cur` scale (Domination −5, the armored toggles −10); a
 * `MezResist` row on a non-`Res_Boolean` table is Repel *resistance*, not protection
 * (branch 2b), so Domination's `MezResist/Repel 100` stays in the mez-resistance family
 * rather than double-counting here.
 *
 * Lives OUTSIDE atom-query.ts because that file is on the shared identical-status manifest, so
 * every edit to it forks the pair and has to be mirrored and re-recorded — the same
 * call-site-hosted precedent as `mezSourceFor` in character-totals.ts. Both repos carry this
 * module at the same path and the same bytes; the STRIP-1 sweep and the totals import from
 * here so the "reader must be the SAME one the totals path calls" doctrine holds for the
 * tripwire.
 *
 * Measured against the `effects.repel` read it replaces, on the four datasets both repos ship:
 * 202 powers agree, 71 lose a credit and 15 gain one, and the direction is the point. The 71
 * are offensive repel — Ki Push, Jet Stream, Hurricane, Repulsion Field — where the bag handed
 * the caster protection equal to the push the power inflicts on everyone else. The 15 are the
 * real thing, including Increase Density, which the retired block named in its own comment as
 * the example and did not actually read.
 *
 * Fork-resolved at the call site (the caller passes the build's {@link mezSource}); the
 * caller's `|scale| × table@50` gate and the non-Res_Boolean self-atom credit rule match
 * the KB arm exactly.
