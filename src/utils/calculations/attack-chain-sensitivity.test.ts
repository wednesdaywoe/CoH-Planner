/**
 * Which team buffs the Attack Chain Builder's own sliders offer — measured, not declared.
 *
 * The chain modal offers a SUBSET of the what-if layer: the stats a rotation's timing, damage
 * and endurance actually move with. That subset is the kind of list that rots quietly — the
 * chain grows or loses a dependency, and the modal keeps offering a control that changes
 * nothing (or stops offering one that would). Nothing fails and the numbers stay plausible.
 *
 * So `CHAIN_WHAT_IF_STATS` is not trusted here. Every key the engine's vocabulary offers is
 * pushed through the whole chain pipeline — totals → chain powers → endurance params → the
 * recharge divisor and the always-on ToHit the snipe rule reads — and the declaration is held
 * to exactly the set that moved something.
 *
 * The rebuild runs the same measurement against its own chain (`chain_sensitivity_gate.rs`).
 * The two sets are NOT expected to match: this planner resolves the fast-snipe form from
 * `permanentToHit`, so +ToHit moves a chain here and does not there (DATA-GAP-REGISTER
 * CHAIN-1). A difference is a finding to record, not a bug to smooth over.
