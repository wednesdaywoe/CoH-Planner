/**
 * A caster-form switch, in seconds of RAW animation (pre-ArcanaTime). These two
 * are CHAIN-LAYER modelling constants and live here beside {@link POWER_FORMS}
 * for the same reason it does.
 *
 * They must never be written into the export tree, a dataset's generated layer,
 * or a dataset overrides file. Both are INFERRED; putting an inferred number
 * where extracted data lives makes it indistinguishable from extracted data, and
 * it would then survive a future re-export as a stale pin.
 *
 * ── Where they come from ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The four Kheldian form toggles (Black Dwarf, Dark Nova, Bright Nova, White
 * Dwarf) carry `activation_time 0.0`. That is REAL data, not an extraction gap.
 * Decoding `bin_sequencers.pigg → bin/sequencers.bin` shows why — the sequencer
 * author SPLIT the shapeshift move in two:
 *
 *   TRANSFORM_KHELDIAN   (ground, move 2563)  <body>/PRE_POISON  frames 1 → 2
 *                                             + FEET/TRANSFORM.FX
 *   TRANSFORM_KHELDIAN2  (move 2564)          <body>/PRE_POISON  frames 3 → end
 *
 * The first segment is the BLOCKING cast: 2 frames = 0.0667s at 30fps, with the
 * frame rate calibrated against 96 move↔power pairs — exact hits that reproduce
 * the 2-dp rounding in the power definitions. From frame 3 the second move
 * auto-chains as a NON-blocking segment carrying eight interrupt states
 * (<DEATHIRQ> <HITIRQ> <REACTIRQ> <ATTACKIRQ> <BLOCKIRQ> <MOVEIRQ>
 * <IRQEMOTESALL> <IRQENCOUNTERS>), so attacking or moving truncates it. That is
 * the animation-cancel Homecoming players use, and it is a consequence of where
 * the move was split. (Deliberately not written as "frames 3-124": 124 is the
 * shared clip's length, which the next paragraph refutes as evidence about this
 * power — quoting it here as the segment's extent would state the refuted
 * reading as fact two lines before refuting it.)
 *
 * The full uncancelled shift is 2.033s = 61 frames. It is NOT the 124-frame
 * (4.133s) clip: that reading was REFUTED — 124 frames is the length of the
 * shared clip, and the power→move binding is by NAME only, so the clip's length
 * is not evidence about this power. The 61 frames come from a sibling-power
 * oracle instead: seven sibling powers performing the same shapeshift with the
 * same BLASTERSHAPSHIFT FX (including NPC re-issues of these very powers), plus
 * DEACTIVATE_KHELDIAN — the return to human — reading 61 independently.
 *
 * ── Why 0.067 and not 0 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 0.067 is a measured number, and `calculateArcanaTime` treats it as one:
 * (ceil(0.067 / 0.132) + 1) × 0.132 = 0.264s. Passing 0 instead takes the
 * function's `<= 0` branch and returns a bare 0.132s tick, which is a different
 * — and wrong — answer.
