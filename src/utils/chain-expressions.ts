/**
 * Humanizers for the two chain-power RPN expressions the bin parser recovers
 * from powers.bin (fields 43b / 38) and the converter carries onto `Power`:
 *
 *   - `chainTargetExpression` — ChainTarget: which target a chain jumps to next.
 *   - `maxTargetsExpression`  — MaxTargetsExpr: a conditional target cap that
 *     overrides the static `stats.maxTargets` when its condition holds.
 *
 * The raw token lists (e.g. `101 kHitPoints% target> - … prevdistance / +`) are
 * meaningless to players, so the Info panel shows these short descriptions and
 * keeps the raw expression on hover. Verified against the HC `.powers` oracle —
 * see streams/HOMECOMING_PARSER.md ("Chain / max-targets expression fields").
 *
 * Both take the token list and join it only to ASK a question of it: every probe
 * below is a substring test, and a token boundary can neither create nor destroy
 * a substring. Nothing here splits the joined text back apart, which is the step
 * COND-8 was about.
