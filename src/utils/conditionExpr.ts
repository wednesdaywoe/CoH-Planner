/**
 * A minimal evaluator for the CoH RPN condition language, scoped to exactly the vocabulary
 * that appears in `quickSnipe.condition` / `formVariants[].condition` across all three forks
 * today (`condition` is the only place either string exists on `Power` — see
 * docs/gaps/engine-beta-parity.md). NOT a general port of canonical's `coh_math::expr`
 * (~1200 lines, 47 readers, probabilistic Die/Range values) — this only needs the
 * source-relative subset those two fields actually use.
 *
 * The grammar is whitespace-delimited postfix (reverse Polish): each token either pushes a
 * value or pops its operands and pushes a result, and the result is whatever sits on top of
 * the stack once every token has run (`cur.kToHit source> .97 >=` pushes `cur.kToHit`, reads
 * it via `source>`, pushes `.97`, then `>=` pops both and pushes the comparison).
 *
 * A token this can't resolve — a target-relative reader (`target.isFriend?`, `enttype
 * target>`, `distance`), or a source reader whose attribute a static build has no value for
 * (`kMeter source>`) — pushes UNKNOWN rather than aborting, and unknown propagates through
 * the operators the way canonical's `Value::Unknown` does (EXPR-1). `evaluateConditionTri`
 * reports a program that ends unknown as `undefined`, canonical's `EvalError::Indeterminate`.
 *
 * Propagation is Kleene, not merely sticky, and the difference is load-bearing: `&&`/`||`
 * absorb an unknown when the definite sibling settles it, so `kBoostRange Source.Mode?
 * distance 7 > &&` is definitely FALSE with the mode off even though no planner can value
 * `distance`. Everything else carries the unknown outward — a comparison or an `eq` with an
 * unknown operand is unknown, and `!unknown` is unknown, since negation has no absorbing
 * operand. A symbol where a number or a boolean belongs stays a hard fault, as it is there:
 * Kleene absorbs unknowns, never grammar faults. Both faults and unknowns surface here as the
 * one `undefined`, which is what the engine's callers do with `Err(_)` either way.
 *
 * Whether "can't tell" may be folded into "no" is the CALLER's question, not this module's,
 * and the two callers answer it differently (U8):
 *
 * - Asking one condition, `fast_form_selected`-style, the fold is sound: the engine is
 *   `matches!(eval_bool(…), Ok(true))`, so a definite no and an unanswerable gate both leave
 *   the base record standing. `evaluateCondition` is that fold, and `quickSnipe` uses it.
 * - Walking an ORDERED list, it is not. `with_form_variant` matches three ways — `Ok(true)`
 *   selects and stops, `Ok(false)` moves on, `Err(_)` returns None and abandons the walk. Fold
 *   the third into the second and the walk keeps going, so a constant-true fallback parked
 *   behind an unanswerable branch gets selected. That is Assassin's Strike: `kMeter` is
 *   rotation state no static build can answer, and a constant-true `1` sits right behind it.
 *   `applyFormVariant` therefore reads the tri-valued form and stops where the engine stops.
 *
 * This module was two-valued until 2026-08-21, and the fold looked correct because it was
 * checked against `fast_form_selected` — the caller for which it IS correct. Kleene came in
 * with it: while every unknown collapsed to `false` the absorbing cases reached the same
 * answer by luck, and only a caller that ACTS on unknown can tell the two apart.
