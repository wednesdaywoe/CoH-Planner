/**
 * Conditional-effect selection — shared between the power-display layer
 * (`powerDisplayUtils`, InfoPanel, MechanicAdjusters) and the dashboard calc
 * (`character-totals`).
 *
 * A power's `conditionalEffects` are contributions gated on a caster/target
 * state (Bio Armor adaptation modes, Hide, Domination, drowning, …). This
 * module decides *which* of those are active given the current toggle state.
 * It lives under `utils/` (rather than `components/info/`) so the calc layer
 * can import it without a backwards components→calc dependency.
 *
 * The display-side *merge* (`applyActiveConditionals`, which layers the active
 * subset onto a Power for rendering) stays in `powerDisplayUtils` — the calc
 * doesn't merge; it feeds each active conditional through the same active-power
 * bonus machinery so collisions sum correctly (see `expandActiveConditionals`).

/**
 * Conditional `id`s that correspond to AT-inherent mechanics already
 * driven by the Header's mechanic bar (Domination, Hide, Fury, etc.).
 * For these ids:
 *   - The MechanicAdjusters InfoPanel section hides its toggle (the
 *     Header already owns the user-facing control).
 *   - `selectActiveConditionals` reads the corresponding existing state
 *     via the `atInherentState` argument instead of `mechanicAdjusters` /
 *     `globalAdjusters`. The merger still layers the binary's actual
 *     conditional templates on top of the base when the AT toggle is on.
 *   - The dashboard calc *skips* them (they already have dedicated total
 *     handling elsewhere) to avoid double-counting.
 *
 * Add new mappings here when a freshly-recognized gate id collides with
 * something the dashboard already controls. Keep curated rather than
 * auto-detected — the binary uses opaque attribute names like
 * `kStealth` that map to different mechanics per AT.
