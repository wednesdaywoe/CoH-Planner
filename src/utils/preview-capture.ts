/**
 * Singleton bridge from the always-mounted off-screen `<BuildPreviewCard>`
 * (see `SharePreviewCapture`) to `shareBuild()` in `sharedBuilds.ts`, which is
 * a plain service module and can't use React hooks itself. The component
 * registers its capture node on mount/update; `capturePreviewPng()` rasterizes
 * whatever is currently registered — i.e. the live build at call time.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: a share must never fail because the preview capture
 * wasn't ready or the DOM rasterizer errored. Callers get `null` on any
 * failure and proceed without a preview image.
