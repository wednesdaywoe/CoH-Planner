/**
 * Which duration a rendered effect row states, and which one the power-level row states.
 *
 * A module of its own for the reason `resolvePowerMagnitudes` is one: the precedence is the
 * subject under test, and `RegistryEffectsDisplay` is a React component with no render harness
 * in this repo. Grading it through the component would mean grading it through nothing.
 *
 * The precedence exists because the same question has three possible answers after STRIP-1
 * (PROD6B-BETA-PARITY class 2):
 *
 *  - the ENGINE row's `duration`, which is `recorded_duration` off the atom-derived `durations`
 *    map, so it is the base power's own clock;
 *  - the display bag's per-effect `durations` map;
 *  - the bag's power-level `buffDuration`.
 *
 * The last two are what a stripped bag leaves behind, and they state something else. Dual
 * Pistols' `Executioners_Shot` carries a 10s `buffDuration` that belongs to the `iceammo`
 * conditional entry, on a power whose only ungated duration is the 8s `-Def`. Dark Miasma's
 * `Howling_Twilight` carries 1s, the `EntCreate` marker picked up by the summon-lifespan
 * backfill that fires only because the bag has no duration left to block it, on a power whose
 * debuffs run 30s. So the row wins wherever there is a row, and the bag still answers for a
 * caller that resolved the bag itself.
