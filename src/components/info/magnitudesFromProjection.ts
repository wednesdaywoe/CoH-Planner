/**
 * The engine's resolved granted magnitudes, reshaped into the rows `RegistryEffectsDisplay`
 * renders (ENGLAG-1 / PROD6C-3).
 *
 * The display used to resolve its own rows from a bag the surface built. That bag's only
 * authored source was the power's wire `effects`, and STRIP-1 removed it, so
 * `buildDisplayEffects` now returns the keys it mints for itself and nothing else. Around
 * 2,700 powers per fork carry atoms and produce no effect row at all. The engine never had
 * that problem: `granted::atom_seed` projects the display bag from the atom stream, resolves
 * it, and hands back the finished rows. This maps those rows onto the shape the component
 * already renders, which is what makes the swap a re-point rather than a rewrite.
 *
 * Three things the engine states that the resolver's shape has nowhere to put, and where they
 * go instead:
 *
 * - The mez FACE. `mez_face_label` suffixes a protection row with "Prot" and a self-directed
 *   one with "(Self)". Those live in `label`, so the label renders as-is and the verdict is
 *   restated on [`ResolvedMagnitude.mezFace`] for the grouping pass, rather than sniffed a
 *   second time off a `rawValue` these rows do not carry.
 * - `ignoresStrength`. The engine already collapsed such a row to three equal tiers, which is
 *   the whole of what the flag drives here.
 * - `rawValue`. There is no authored value behind an engine row, and the field stays
 *   `undefined`. Its consumers all guard with `isMezEffect` / `isScaledEffect`, so they
 *   decline rather than break; see the note on `RegistryEffectsDisplay`'s `rows` prop.
 *
 * Presentation the engine does not carry (`colorClass`, `enhancementAspect`, `canBeByType`)
 * joins from the local registry by `effectKey`. Both sides read the same generated
 * `contract/effect-registry.json`, so a key the engine resolved and this one does not hold is
 * a vendor skew, not a row to draw in a default style.
