/**
 * PAR2 — the mutex half of a `mode: 'replace'` conditional.
 *
 * A power can carry two damage groups gated on a predicate and on its negation, which makes
 * them the same template read under opposite conditions. Turning the toggle on has to swap
 * them, not stack them. It stacked them for as long as `applyActiveConditionals` had a damage
 * branch, because that branch read `c.damage` and never `c.mode`: Temporal Mending showed
 * 1.75 + 2.625 with Temporal Selection on, Crushing Uppercut 3.18 + 3.339 at Combo Level 1.
 *
 * `powerProjectionParity` caught two of the 167 powers involved, and only because healing is
 * the one damage row that also surfaces as a granted magnitude. Nothing else diffs the damage
 * array against the engine, so that gate's silence was about its own reach. This one sweeps
 * the array directly.
 *
 * Two halves, because the fix has two:
 *
 *   1. The converter joins each base damage row to the toggles it's mutex with. Graded
 *      against `power.atoms`, which reaches the file through `templatesToAtoms` rather than
 *      `extractDamage` and carries each row's gate verbatim — so the two agreeing is a real
 *      statement about the join and not one field read twice.
 *   2. The merger drops exactly the displaced rows. Graded on the merged array.
 *
 * The counters at the end are what make it non-vacuous. A corpus where every replace-mode
 * toggle displaces something cannot tell this fix from swapping the whole array, and Psi
 * Blade is the case that separates them: it's tagged `replace` off a negated gate on its
 * GrantPower atom while its own damage is a genuinely extra DoT.
