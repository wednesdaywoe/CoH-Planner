/**
 * The **effective power** — which power a display surface is actually showing (PROD6C-3k).
 *
 * `buildDisplayEffects` and the bag transforms beside it are pure functions of one power
 * object. This resolves WHICH power that object is, from the build's combat state:
 *
 * 1. **mode redirect** — while a caster mode is live, the game's PowerRedirector fires a
 *    different record entirely (a Kheldian attack in Nova form, a Titan Weapons attack under
 *    Momentum). The converter carries the whole table as `power.modeVariants`.
 * 2. **form variant** — an ordered table of alternate records gated by a condition string read
 *    verbatim off the binary (`power.formVariants`, first match wins) rather than a mode key —
 *    Energy Manipulation's Stun becoming a slower AoE under Power Boost. `conditionExpr.ts`
 *    evaluates the condition; canonical closed the matching engine side 2026-08-07
 *    (`coh_math::effective::with_form_variant`) — see docs/gaps/engine-beta-parity.md PARITY-1.
 * 3. **quick snipe** — in combat, a snipe shows its fast cast/range and the quick form's damage.
 *    Which state actually GATES the fast form is fork-specific and lives in
 *    `power.quickSnipe.condition` (SNIPE-2) — see docs/gaps/engine-beta-parity.md PARITY-2.
 * 4. **mid-combat cast** — an opener with a separate `midCombatCast` uses it when NOT hidden;
 *    the slow interruptible animation is the from-Hide one.
 * 5. **active conditionals** — the mode-gated contributions whose toggle is on merge onto
 *    `effects` and `damage`, with the additive collisions returned as `extraInstances`.
 *
 * Extracted from `InfoPanel`'s memos so the panel, the picker tooltip, and the engine gate all
 * resolve the same power.
 *
 * The engine mirrors every rule here in `coh_math/src/effective.rs`; the projection's values
 * describe this power, keyed to the base power's identity.
