/**
 * Attack Chain Builder modal.
 *
 * Click powers to greedily pack an attack rotation (one animation at a time).
 * The scheduler anchors recharge to cast END — `findSlot` in attack-chain.ts is
 * explicit that a prior cast at [start, end] makes the power ready at
 * `end + effRech` — so this docstring's old claim of "anchored to cast start"
 * was simply wrong about the module it pointed at. The TIMELINE below still
 * draws both cooldown visuals from cast start (`cdW`, `overStart`), which is a
 * real rendering discrepancy of one animation length, tracked separately; it is
 * a drawing bug, not the scheduling rule. Drag a bar on the
 * timeline to reorder the cast sequence; grab empty space to pan. Surfaces
 * cycle time, DPS, dead time, and an endurance gain/spend model with a
 * sustainability sawtooth. All per-power numbers come from the live build via
 * the same calc the power tooltips use (attack-chain-powers.ts).
 *
 * CROSS-FORM ROTATIONS. A Kheldian chain can shapeshift mid-rotation. The
 * palette is a UNION across caster forms, so a power the current form cannot
 * cast is DIMMED rather than absent — you can see what a switch would unlock —
 * and a `→ Form` chip appends the shift as a step like any other pick. Because a
 * union palette cannot prevent an illegal pick, `computeChain` detects one
 * instead and this surface marks it (red ring, ⚠, the reason on hover) while
 * still showing every number: a half-shifted chain is one the user is mid-edit
 * on. The Form control picks where the rotation OPENS, not where it lives.
 *
 * The shift cost is an ASSUMPTION, and the surface says so wherever it shows.
 * By default a switch costs only the blocking segment its animation actually
 * locks you out for, because a chain that attacks straight afterwards cancels
 * the rest by construction; the "Play shift animations in full" checkbox charges
 * the whole shift instead. Cycle and DPS carry a persistent marker while it is
 * on, the clipboard export names whichever assumption produced its numbers, and
 * the Efficiency help says outright that a switch counts as busy but deals no
 * damage. See SHAPESHIFT_BLOCKING_CAST / SHAPESHIFT_FULL_ANIM for provenance.

  //     is absorbed by dead time the loop already had. Cycle, Total dmg and DPS
  //     come out bit-for-bit identical (22.24s / 22.40 DPS either way) and
  //     Efficiency moves instead, 39% → 57%.
  // Marking only Cycle and DPS therefore put the pill on two numbers the box had
  // not changed while the one it had changed wore none. Efficiency now carries it
  // too. See the two-regime gate in attack-chain-cross-form.test.ts.
  //
  // And the pill rides BOTH states, because the default is an assumption too —
